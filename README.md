# Game API
This API includes a microservice that implements CRUD for games and publishers.
Also it will also be possible:
- To fetch only the publisher data for a given game (without any publishers dedicated API â€“ i.e. only by
using the game API)
- To trigger a process which will automatically remove the games having a release date older than 18
months and apply a discount of 20% to all games having a release date between 12 and 18 months.

Games request logics are located in
